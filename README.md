# ü§ñ AI-Powered PR Review Agent

This project is an intelligent code review agent designed to analyze pull requests. It uses a powerful AI model to provide comprehensive feedback on code structure, quality, potential bugs, and overall best practices.

This solution was developed for the **#SRMHacksWithCodemate** Hackathon, specifically addressing the "PR (Pull Request) Review Agent" problem statement.


## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Provider Architecture**: Built with full, tested support for **GitHub**. The modular design is ready to integrate **GitLab** and **Bitbucket**‚Äîjust add the appropriate API keys in the `.env` file.
* **Comprehensive AI Analysis**: Leverages the `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` model via Hugging Face to generate in-depth code reviews covering:
   * Code Structure & Quality
   * Potential Bugs & Issues
   * Security Vulnerabilities
   * Performance Optimizations
* **PR Quality Scoring**: Calculates a quality score for each pull request based on the AI's analysis to provide an at-a-glance assessment.
* **Dual Review Modes**:
   1. **URL Analysis**: Simply paste a PR link for a full review.
   2. **Direct Diff Upload**: Paste raw `git diff` content for a quick analysis without needing a URL.
* **Clean Web Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript for ease of use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Flask (Python)
* **AI Integration**: Hugging Face `transformers` library
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the PR Review Agent running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* A Hugging Face account and an API Key

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanalokeshreddy/pr-review-agent.git
cd pr-review-agent
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2. Add your Hugging Face API key. For extended provider support, you can add their keys here as well.

```env
# Required for AI analysis
HF_API_KEY=hf_YourHuggingFaceApiKeyGoesHere

# Optional: Add keys for GitLab and Bitbucket support
# GITLAB_TOKEN=your_gitlab_personal_access_token
# BITBUCKET_USERNAME=your_bitbucket_username
# BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD=your_bitbucket_app_password
```

### Step 3: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

Start the Flask server.

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will now be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open this URL in your browser to start reviewing pull requests!
